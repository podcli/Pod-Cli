## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Often, we find ourselves in situations where we can't spare enough time to listen to our beloved podcast. As technology enthusiasts, Pod-Cli transforms your humungous audio podcasts into text and provide you with a concise summary. The best part is that you can now enjoy listening to your favorite music while simultaneously reading the summarized text of your podcast.



## How Pod-Cli works:
1. We take the data from the YouTube/Spotify database and use [Natural Language Processing](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/natural-language-processing) to convert the speech into [text files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file).
2. The obtained transcript are then processed through [regex](https://regex101.com) to shorten it by removing repetitions and complexity.
3. It is then given to the [GPT-3](https://openai.com/product) api to come up with a summary.
Tech Stack: [Python](http://www.python.org)/[Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [Bash Scripting](https://www.javatpoint.com/bash-scripting).
